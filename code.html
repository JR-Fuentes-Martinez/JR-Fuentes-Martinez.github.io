                            <p><em>PRELIMINARY</em> <small><i>(On the go until further revision. Read with tweezers)</i></small></p>
                            <p>
                                We want to call '<strong>inertial factor</strong>' to any factor applied to the diff(erential) variable which in turn implies
                                in any way that it can be understood as another diff function identifying a <i>slope</i> which can be measured
                                in angular units (e.g. radian). Therefore, it can be shown as a phasor being able to rotate on a circumference with
                                angles determined by such slope value. Any change is a rotation from an initial angular position to a new one. One
                                special case is that in which such slope is the same diff variable, finally meaning an aritmethic power of two. 
                                Doing so, we are defying infinitum values that other approachs can reach. There's not an infinite value but an 
                                arctangent of a right angle, that between two lines or planes with no projections from one to the other. There is
                                enough evidence and experience of its existence in what is and is existing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being such factor the <strong>mass</strong> as an example, this implies first that it is a slope or diff function,
                                and so with a possible primitive one which can be reached by this diff accumulation. This accumulation in order to
                                fullfill some units rules will loose the time as inherited dimension in the denominator. Matching this function to
                                a new given variable should supposedly consider the lost time dimension. It was not the case but that new variable
                                has to be understood as the accumulation in the whole time. It has not to be multiplied by time for the equality to occur.

                                This so simple algorythm tries to be the implementation of a rigorous aproximation to the measure of natural magnitudes, understood as 
                                the multiplication of an absolute number by an unit which is chosen and made inmutable in time. These magnitudes
                                are related among them by something more than an absolute mathematic equality. It is an equality forming <strong>Functions</strong>.
                                Functions that take into account the equality through its independent variable range. Maybe the most important, those with <strong>Time</strong>
                                being such variable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the other way, there is not any 'a priori' need to manage the aritmethic división operation. They have not to be understood like any
                                kind of cast. Any cast, only when needed being the numerator a whole thing an the denominator something by such thing is divided and 
                                probably destroyed
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because all them, the magnitud values we call 'primitives' are correlated with a simple <strong>1,2,3 ... n</strong> serie being the 
                                number of such units it contains. Functions can be known showing an infinite range of values or alternatively and more usual, 
                                tabular data in units of a time. In the former case, there is uncertainty among annotated values. The chosen algorythm 
                                deals with that trying to be neutral.
                            </p>
                            <p>                            
                                Finally the evolution graph show those differential values versus the time in its units, days. Therefore, the labels have a format
                                of month/day, uniquely identifying them. Adding possible multipliers as any kind of inertial factor (mass, specific heat, latent heat,
                                etc.) the result is an expressión of impulse or power in any way. A factor of density may be associated with the concept of concentration 
                                or fraction, being the SIC or SIF an expression of a partial amount of the total. On the other hand, it can be useful with continental
                                ice with another dynamic. The big differences among sea and continental ice probably lie on both the lesser constant liquid phase 
                                and temperature of the inner substrate being able to reach lower values than in water at least for some time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also 'we' are trying to relate this possible indicator with the temperature and specific humidity in different layers of the GFS 
                                levels until the 10HPa, being stationally the hot or cold vertical cryospheric focus. Such evolution could be interesting to open a more
                                precise understanding of polar high level vortex. We would begin with the measure exactly in the polar spot at lat[90] and lat[-90]
                                being the theoric place of maximum linear velocity due to the rotation of the Earth. Being only a person I was very satisfied with any other
                                related devolopment by other persons or instituions. This person believe that this couldn't be dedicated to personal or
                                enterprise commmerce. Too much simple. Nothing to gain in the first minute. A lot of work to do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The included <strong>Net effect</strong> is no more than the add with signs of such differential values for the period of one year. 
                                The intent is to reach a value for an enough reduction from days to years. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note1: We observe any kind of possible spurious values in some of the series. Any help will be always welcome.<br>
                                Note2: The Net Effect algorythm is still under revision.
